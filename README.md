# crimson-3dme
 
This /me, /do script has been made completely standalone and compatible with both RedM and FiveM servers and I thought I'd share it!

/tag and /focus will add a permanent text to your character, tag being visible at all times within range and focus being visible only if the player is locked onto a target that has a focus tag! 
/tag R_Hand <message> will attach the tag to the right hand bone with the message
  If you want to remove a bone tag, just do for example: /tag R_Hand and it will delete that tag
  Same can be done with /focus
/me, /do and /say appear over the top of the player's head

All scripts are unlocked and a Configuration File is included to easily configure the resource to your liking!

Also an optional /try command
